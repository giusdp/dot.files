My dot files for my Arch Linux, I3-gaps setup. 


All it needs is:
 - Polybar (for the status bar)
 - PyWal (for the color scheme)
 - Feh (for the background image)
 - Rofi (for the app launcher)
 - The font Hack
 - Urxtv (The terminal)
 - Compton (Compositor for nice effects like shadows, 
transparency and blurs)

After installing PyWal (and it's dependencies) run it on the wallpaper in the Wallpaper folder. It will create the colorscheme that will be used everywhere.
